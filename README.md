## Action List

### TOR Utilities

As I have a few hidden services, I need a way of deploying to them from a git repo. Thanks to github actions this is possible.

* [***torscp***](https://github.com/nolim1t/actions/tree/master/torscp) - Action Name: ***nolim1t/actions/torscp@0.2.0***  (takes 3 variables: PRIVATE_KEY, SRC, DEST)
* [**torssh**](https://github.com/nolim1t/actions/tree/master/torssh) - SSH command over tor! Action name ***nolim1t/actions/torssh@0.2.0***. This is still experimental and untested!
